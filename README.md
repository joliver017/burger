## Description
The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu, which will add the entry to a MySQL database. When the entry is made, it's first placed into the "Burgers To Eat!" side on the left. The user can then click on the burger to eat it, which will move it to the "Burgers Eaten!" side on the right, and updates its status accordingly in the MySQL database. HTML templating implemented with Handlebars, and the application is hosted on Heroku.
