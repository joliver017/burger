# Burger!
This application allows users to log burgers they've eaten (but you can log anything really).

## Description
This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Materialize framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu, which will add the entry to a MySQL database. When the entry is made, it's first placed into the "Burgers To Eat!" side on the left. The user can then click on the burger to eat it, which will move it to the "Burgers Eaten!" side on the right, and updates its status accordingly in the MySQL database.
